### I can isolate information from a larger dataset

In the code chunk below, I load `{gapminder}` and store the `gapminder` dataset to your environment with the `data` function.
Note, you may need to install `{gapminder}` in the **Console** if you experience issues.
Follow these best practices prior to doing that: [Use Caution When Installing Packages in RStudio Server](https://hpcsupport.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portal/3/article/562429973)

```{r load_gapminder}
library(gapminder)
data(gapminder)
```

For each year, find the two countries on the continent of Asia that had the largest and smallest `lifeExp`.
Your final tibble should display the following columns in this order:

- `year` (sorted oldest entries first)
- `country`
- `lifeExp`

End your pipeline with `print(n = 24)` to display all 24 rows (12 years x 2 countries per year).

```{r large_small_lifeExp}

```


### I can combine information from multiple sources

In the code chunk below, I store the `gapminder_unfiltered` dataset to your environment with the `data` function.

```{r load_gapminder_unfiltered}
data(gapminder_unfiltered)
```

Using the `gapminder` (from DW.3) and `gapminder_unfiltered` datasets, create one tibble that has 6 rows and only the following columns:

- `continent`: The 6 "continents"
- `count_gapminder`: number of entries in each continent for `gapminder`
- `count_unfiltered`: number of entries in each continent for `gapminder_unfiltered`
- `difference`: difference between the two count columns

```{r country_difference}

```


### I can identify if information is presented in a tidy format and restructure information to be in a tidy format

You have been given a CSV file `infant_hiv.csv` that is formatted as follows:

|ISO3 |2009 est  |2009 hi  |2009 lo  |2010 est  |2010 hi  |2010 lo  |
|:----|:---------|:--------|:--------|:---------|:--------|:--------|
|ALB  |-         |-        |-        |-         |-        |-        |
|BLR  |>95%      |>95%     |>95%     |>95%      |>95%     |>95%     |
|BLZ  |77%       |89%      |3%       |75%       |88%      |3%       |
|BRA  |25%       |35%      |19%      |25%       |35%      |19%      |

- The first column is ISO3 country codes.
- There are three columns for each year from 2009 to 2017. Each set has estimated, low, and high values for the year (in that order).
- A dash `-` indicates that no data is available.
- Our analyst tells us that `>95% `means “the data is unreliable” and thus should be treated as missing.

Below I read in the file `infant_hiv.csv` and store the result in a tibble called `infant_hiv`. Note that I am treating `"-"` and `">95%"` as missing values.

```{r load_person_data}
infant_hiv <- read_csv("data/infant_hiv.csv", na = c("-", ">95%"))
```

Your task is to turn this into a tidy data table for further analysis:

First, describe what a tidy layout for this data would look like and why.



Now, turn this data into a tidy version of the table.

```{r infant_hiv_tidy}

```


### I can create tables of numerical summaries that draw attention to important comparisons

Below I read in data for all 307 victims of the Halloween and Friday the 13th movie series (as of 2016) collected by Dr. Mary Richardson (of GVSU!).

```{r load_horror}
horror <- haven::read_sav("https://introstat.weebly.com/uploads/3/1/1/8/31183735/horror_movies.sav") %>% 
  haven::as_factor() %>% 
  mutate(Gender = case_when(
    Gender == "F" ~ "Female",
    TRUE ~ "Male"
  ))
```

There are three variables in this dataset:

- `Gender`: Gender of the character killed
- `Category`: The way in which each character is killed
- `Franchise`: The movie franchise the character is from


Create one summary table that displays the co-occurrences (i.e., frequencies) for the three variables in this dataset.
You are primarily interested in comparing the numbers of deaths for a particular way in which characters are killed across the different genders.
Hint: you will need to restructure your table to make comparisons more "human-readable".

```{r co_occurrences}

```

### I can create graphical display of data that highlight key features

Using the `horror` dataset from DS.1, create a bar graph that displays the co-occurrences for the ways in which each character is killed across the different genders in this dataset.
You must use informative labels and values, a title, etc.
Again, you are primarily interested in comparing the numbers of deaths for a particular way in which characters are killed across the different genders.

```{r chunk_name}
```


### I can identify and correct common errors and in R programs

The `gapminder` dataset has multiple measurements for each country

The code below is suppose to create a plot of these data, where:

- Each dot represents one year for each country *i*.
- The color of each dot represents the continent for that country.
- The *X* coordinate for the year/country *i* is life expectancy.
- The *Y* coordinate for the year/country *i* is gdp per capita.
- The one line is created using the `'lm'` *method* for all continents (not the individual continents) without the *standard error* band.
- The points opacity is set to a transparency level of 0.2.

Correct this code in the empty code chunk below to produce the desired results, fixing any mistakes you notice in the plot along the way.

```{r plot_error}
gapminder %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = lifeExp, y = gdpPercap, color = country)) +
  geom_point(aes(alpha = 0.2)) +
  geom_smooth()
```

```{r fix_error}

```


### I can explore new functions or packages and implement them into analysis

Look into the documentation for the [`{praise}`](https://github.com/rladies/praise) package.
Before installing this, remember the recommended workflow [from HPC](https://hpcsupport.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portal/3/article/562429973).
Provide yourself with three affirmations.

```{r affirmative_this}

```
